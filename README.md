## Project Description

This is a iframe twin of the project [panelCopilot](https://github.com/arivero/panelCopilot).
If you are looking for a solution closer to Google Deepmind's __Project Mariner__, start there.
If you are going for a solution to navigate CORS-compatible websites, usually all of them
under your control, and you can not afford to depend on chrome extensions, this could be the
way... if I finish it.
